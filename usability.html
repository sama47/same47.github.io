			<h1>Usability study</h1>
				<h2>method</h2>
					<p>we studied the tsa website, the target audience is members of the tsa, they were assigned to find the national confernce tab then find th epage for the 2014 venue and find the contact infromation.</p>
				<h2>results</h2>
					<p>the subject was eaily able to complete the task, she did it fairly quickly and wihtout any issues and it was only done in 3 steps.</p>
				<h2>discussion</h2>
					<p>i learned from this lesson that the tsas website is definitly made well adn i wouldnt expect anything less from a technoly website,its very effective but the website looks out of date for modern designs</p>
